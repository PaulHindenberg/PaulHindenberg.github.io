            Hello.
            <br> I'm Paul and I welcome you to my site.
            <br> I currently live between Cologne and Bonn where I'm employed at Sch√∂nhofer Sales and Engineering GmbH.
            <br> Here, I'm working mostly as an Software Engineer and Solution Architect.
            <br> Before my current employment I was working as a ( not only ) SAP developer as well as technical Consultant on
            various projects. I made my master's degree in Information Management and Consulting (MSc.) in Ludwigshafen am
            Rhein, University of Applied Science, based in Germany. As Freelancer, I was using my knowledge in different
            projects, mostly as Application Developer or/and Consultant.
            <p style="font-size: 13px;">I mostly use this Website to keep track and to represent my doings (to find interesting projects {..or job offers}).[Last

            <!--Hello,<br>
